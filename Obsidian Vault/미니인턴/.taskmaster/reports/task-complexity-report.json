			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Initialize Node.js project and package.json configuration, 2) Install and configure TypeScript with tsconfig.json, 3) Install Express.js and essential middleware (cors, helmet, dotenv), 4) Create project folder structure and development scripts",
			"reasoning": "Standard project initialization with well-established patterns. Low complexity due to conventional setup, but multiple configuration files need careful coordination."
